        "**Anomaly Detection** is the identification of rare items, events or suspicious observations, since they are far from common operations over the data. Tipically, anomaly detection may regard bank frauds, a structural defect, medical issues or text errors. Apply here Deep Learning by exploiting some anomaly detection datasets. The first is, a credit card frauds dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. Make and Exploratory Analysis and a Supervised Anomaly Detection with Deep Neural Netoworks. If needed, make use of other public datasets. Make all necessary plots and panels. "
